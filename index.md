Hello, I'm Sebastian Wiesner, software developer by occupation and by passion.

I write Scala for a living, and a couple of other languages for fun and a better
world—mostly Haskell and Rust.  I use to write Python for almost a decade, and
created Windows GUI applications with WPF and C#.  I’ve also done a bit of
OCaml, and occasionally work on iOS Apps with Swift.

I use [Emacs][] for most of my work, and maintain a couple of Emacs packages,
most notably [Flycheck][].

In this blog, I mostly write about Emacs, but occasionally also about other
topics, which are of course related to technology and programming.

You can find my open source work on [Github][], read my answers on
[Stack Overflow][] and follow me on [Twitter][].
