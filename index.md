> A personal blog about Emacs and functional programming.

Hello, I'm Sebastian Wiesner, software developer by occupation and by passion.
You can find my open source work on [Github][], read my answers on
[Stack Overflow][] and follow me on [Twitter][].

I write Scala for a living and a couple of other languages for fun and a better
world—mostly Haskell and Rust.  I used to write Python for almost a decade, and
created Windows GUI applications with WPF and C#.  I’ve also done a bit of
OCaml, and occasionally work on iOS Apps with Swift.  I use [Spacemacs][] for
most of this, and maintain a couple of Emacs packages, most notably
[Flycheck][].

## Posts ##

I write infrequently, mostly about Emacs and functional programming.  These are
my latest posts ([Atom feed]({{site.baseurl}}/feed.atom)):
